    <h2>About us</h2>
    MDN (also known as "DDNS" and "mindustry.ddns.net") is a server network in Mindustry. We have opened modes for
    survival, sandbox, PvP, attack, and events. Additionally, we develop plugins (primarily for usage in our own
    servers) that are open-source and are capable of being used by other servers.

        <h3>Survival</h3>
        <sub>mindustry.ddns.net:1000</sub>
        <p>
            Fight your way through endless brutal waves of enemy attacks, all as you build your factory to be efficient,
            powerful, and productive. In the end, your goal is to survive.
        </p>

        <h3>Sandbox</h3>
        <sub>mindustry.ddns.net:2000</sub> <br>
        <sub>mindustry.ddns.net:2001 (whitelist only)</sub>
        <p>
            Harness and apply your creativity with limitless resources and potential. Whether it be factory automation,
            efficient schematic designs, or roleplay — the only limit is your imagination.

    <div class="server-container">
        <h3>PvP</h3>
        <sub>mindustry.ddns.net:3000</sub>
        <p>
            Harness your creativity and put them to the test against other players. Utilize schematics, intellect, and
            strategy to create the ultimate war machine.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="server-container" right>
        <h3>Attack</h3>
